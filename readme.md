## Coding-Assessment
### Bill Yao

#### I am very honoured to be invited for this coding assessment from AccessAlly. 
#### Please read carefully of my code and let me know if you have any question or information needed via my email b29yao@uwaterloo.ca
#### Meanwhile, I am very sorry that I was tested positive for COVID on Sunday, therefore I did not comment very well when I was coding for the answer.

#### Anways, hope you enjoy!
